/// privileged connection asserting about rows: it is tested by asking, as
/// person A, for something only person B may see, and getting nothing back. So
/// the fixture hands out FOUR live clients — [service] (bypasses RLS, for
/// seeding and inspection), [founder] and [member] of family A, and [founderB],
/// the founder of a second family that exists only so "another family" is a
/// real caller and not a hypothesis. Every one of them is a separate
/// [SupabaseClient] holding its own session, which is why this package depends
/// on the pure-Dart `supabase` and never on `supabase_flutter` — the latter is
/// a per-process singleton and could hold exactly one of them.
///
/// **Cleanup has two layers**, both inherited:
///   1. [dispose] always purges this run's data, green or red;
///   2. [initialize] sweeps ORPHANED E2E families (the double signature, older
///      than 2 h) left behind by runs a CI cancellation killed before teardown
///      — self-healing, and the 2 h floor is what stops it robbing a run that
///      is still going.
///
/// The purge itself is the `purge_e2e_family` RPC (service_role only), whose
/// double-signature guard lives in the DATABASE: a fixture bug cannot delete a
