/// S-16 — the IN-CODE authorization that REPLACED the platform's `verify_jwt`
/// gate.
///
/// Five functions had to give the gate up: it only understands the legacy
/// JWT-based keys, so a caller presenting a new-model key (`sb_secret_…` on
/// `apikey`) is rejected at the gateway before the function runs. Turning the
/// gate off is safe ONLY because each of those functions now checks its own
/// callers — and that is what this suite pins.
///
/// Without it the regression is invisible in the happy path: the app and the
/// crons keep working while the functions quietly answer to anyone. An e-mail
/// relay, an account purge and the auto-approval worker are exactly the things
/// that must not become anonymous endpoints.
///
/// `register-invitee` is deliberately absent: it authorizes by invitation token
/// (its caller has no account yet and holds only the public publishable key),
/// and its own suite covers the garbage-token refusal.
///
/// This suite needs NO family — it is here for the aggregating entrypoint's
/// convenience, and it touches nothing the fixture owns.
///
/// Port of `db-gate/Entrelares.IntegrationTests/EdgeFunctionAuthTests.cs`.
