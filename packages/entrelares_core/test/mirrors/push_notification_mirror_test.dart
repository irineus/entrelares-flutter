/// F-09 — the push copy is rendered in Deno, from a catalog that duplicates the
/// Dart one on purpose.
///
/// **Why the duplication exists.** In-app, a notification is rendered on the
/// reader's device by [NotificationRenderer]: the row stores `params` and the
/// sentence is built in that reader's language. A push has no device to render
/// on — the OS shows what arrives, and on iOS a data-only message is throttled
/// and may never be delivered — so the text is assembled server-side, per
/// recipient, exactly as `send-swap-email` already assembles an e-mail. Deno
/// cannot call Dart, so `_shared/push.ts` carries its own copy of the strings.
///
/// **Why it needs a gate.** Every failure mode here is silent. Edit a sentence
/// in the Dart catalog and the push keeps sending the old one — a valid,
/// well-formed sentence that no longer matches what the app shows for the same
/// event. Add a type to the trigger's filter and forget the function's list and
/// the push is dropped after paying for the HTTP call. Drop a key from one
/// language and that reader silently gets Portuguese. None of it breaks a
/// build; all of it is visible only to the person being interrupted.
///
/// Same reasoning as the role-catalog, e-mail-date and auth-mail mirrors — the
/// fourth crossing of the Dart/Deno boundary to get a suite that reads BOTH
/// sides.
