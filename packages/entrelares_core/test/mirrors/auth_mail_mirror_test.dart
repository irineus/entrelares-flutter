/// U-13 — the app WRITES the session's language into the password-reset
/// `redirect_to`, and the `send-auth-email` Edge Function READS it back out.
///
/// The two halves are a Dart constant and a Deno constant, in different
/// languages, in different deployment units, and nothing in either toolchain
/// connects them. Rename one and the other keeps compiling, keeps deploying,
/// keeps passing every other test — and every locked-out English reader
/// silently starts receiving a Portuguese password-reset e-mail. The failure is
/// invisible precisely because the fallback is a perfectly valid language.
///
/// Same reasoning as the role-catalog and date-format mirrors: where a value
/// must be duplicated across the Dart/Deno boundary, the duplication gets a
/// suite that reads BOTH files, so drift is a red gate rather than a slow leak.
///
/// Ported from `entrelares-app` `Entrelares.Tests/AuthMailMirrorTests.cs`
/// (T-56, 24/08/2026). One deliberate strengthening over the original, which
/// pinned a single named method: this reads EVERY `resetPasswordForEmail` call
/// site under `apps/entrelares_app/lib/` and requires each to go through
/// `DeepLinkUrls.updatePasswordFor`. The app has two of them — the anonymous
/// "I forgot mine" route and the profile screen's admin-assisted reset — and
/// the original's shape would have watched only one.
