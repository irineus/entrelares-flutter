// U-13 (pre-production round) — the GoTrue auth e-mails, in the reader's language.
//
// THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. GoTrue owns three of the most important messages the
// product sends — confirm your sign-up, reset your password, confirm an e-mail
// change — and its templates are configured **one per project**. One body, one
// language, every reader. So an English tester who asked for a password reset
// received a Portuguese e-mail while every screen around them was in English.
// U-13 recorded that as out of scope precisely because there was no way to
// branch inside GoTrue.
//
// The way is Supabase's **Send Email Hook**: GoTrue stops sending and hands us
// the message instead — the user, the action type and the token — and we render
// and send it ourselves, through the same Resend account and the same visual
// shell as every other e-mail here.
//
// ── The thing to keep in mind when touching this file ────────────────────────
// Once the hook is enabled, GoTrue does NOT send these e-mails as a fallback.
// If this function fails, nobody can confirm a sign-up and nobody can recover a
// password. Three consequences, all deliberate:
//
//   1. An `email_action_type` we do not recognise is NOT an error — it renders
//      the generic `unknown` copy. A new GoTrue action type must never be the
//      reason someone cannot get into their account.
//   2. Every failure returns a non-2xx. Returning 200 on a failed send would be
//      worse than failing: the app would tell the person "check your e-mail"
//      for a message that is never coming, and they would wait instead of
//      retrying.
//   3. Secrets are read INSIDE the handler. Reading them at module load would
//      make a missing secret a boot crash, and CI redeploys every function on
//      every push — including onto a project where the hook secret does not
//      exist yet.
//
// ── Authorization (S-16) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `verify_jwt = false`, because GoTrue does not call us with a JWT: it signs
// the request with the Standard Webhooks scheme using the hook's own secret.
// That signature IS the authorization, and it is checked before anything else
// is read — same shape as `billing-webhook`'s token check.

/**
 * The language this person reads the app in, best signal first.
 *
 *   1. `profiles.language` — an explicit CHOICE. Someone who picked a language
 *      meant it, and nothing here may override that.
 *   2. the `lang` on `redirect_to` — the screen they were looking at when they
 *      asked. A DETECTION, but a fresh one.
 *   3. `profiles.language_detected` — the screen they were on LAST time. Also a
 *      detection, and a staler one.
 *   4. `user_metadata.language` — what the sign-up form was displayed in. The
 *      one case no column can cover: the profile row is created by
 *      `handle_new_user` from the very insert that triggers the confirmation
 *      e-mail, so it has no detected language yet.
 *   5. pt-BR.
 *
 * <b>Steps 2 and 3 were the wrong way round at first</b>, and QA found it: this
 * read the generated `language_effective`, which is `language ?? language_detected`,
 * and put the whole thing above the screen — on the reasoning that an explicit
 * choice outranks a passing screen. True for `language`; false for
 * `language_detected`, which is not a choice at all. A member who had signed in
 * once in English, signed out, switched the login screen to Portuguese and asked
 * for a reset kept receiving English, because a MONTHS-OLD detection was beating
 * the one they were looking at. Both are detections; the fresher one wins.
 *
 * `language_effective` stays right for `send-swap-email` / `send-account-email`:
 * those are triggered by someone ELSE, so there is no "screen the reader was on"
 * to consult and choice-then-detection is the whole story.
 *
 * Never throws: a lookup failure costs the reader's preferred language, and a
 * Portuguese e-mail is a far better outcome than no e-mail at all.
