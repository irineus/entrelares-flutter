-- T-30 — fix-forward: purge_e2e_family assumed notifications.family_id,
-- but notifications are scoped by RECIPIENT (recipient_profile_id), not by
-- family. First execution failed with 42703 ("column family_id does not
-- exist"). Full CREATE OR REPLACE with the corrected notifications delete;
-- everything else is verbatim from 20260715152254.
