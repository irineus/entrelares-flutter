// The owner found the grid scrolling twice: first because the chrome around it
// had grown, then again with the admin strip on. The cell height is a RANGE
// now — the grid spends whatever the screen gives it, divided by the weeks the
// month really has — so the question this file answers is the one that still
// matters: in the WORST month, is there room left for the cell to reach its
// floor without the grid scrolling?
//
// Scrolling a calendar is not a small annoyance. The whole point of the screen
// is seeing the month at once; a month you have to scroll is a list.
