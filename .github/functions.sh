# The Edge Functions this project deploys, in ONE place.
#
# The app repo kept this list twice — once for the dev lane and once for the prod
# lane — and the two drifted: `billing-store-verify` and `billing-store-webhook`
# shipped to dev in lote 5 and only reached the prod list a promotion later, so
# for a while the store rail had a schema and a switch in production with nothing
# to answer the RTDN. Deploying from a single list is what makes that impossible,
# and `assert_function_list_matches_disk` closes the other half: a function added
# to `supabase/functions/` without being added here fails the run instead of being
# silently never deployed.
#
# The split is about JWT verification, and it is not cosmetic. Anything a THIRD
# PARTY calls (Resend, Asaas, Google RTDN, the GoTrue auth hook) or that runs on a
# schedule carries `--no-verify-jwt`, because the caller has no Supabase session
# and the function does its own authentication (shared token, signature, service
# role). Anything a LOGGED-IN user calls keeps verification on, so the platform
# rejects an anonymous request before our code runs.
